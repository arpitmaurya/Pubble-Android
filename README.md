## Why?

I always wanted a note app to which I could add anything that I found interesting or some important note I wanted to quickly add to my list of stuff or something that I found on the internet that I would like to read or research later while sipping a cup of coffee.

The present note apps have always broken my focus and the momentum that I was having while reading because I needed to do a cumbersome series of steps just to add something,

1. I had to minimise the app on which I was reading.
2. Slide up to the app menu,
3. Click on the search bar,
4. Struggle to write 'kwwp' and then correct it to "keep" and open the Keep notes app and then tap on the plus button and then add the things I want..huff :\

Other cases for opening the note app are very similar to these. Yes, it was inconvenient, at least for me., a lot.

So I thought of making it more efficient for people like me by designing my own notes app with extra touch-ups that dissolve all those steps into a "two-quick step process".

**There are multiple methods through which you can add or reach your notes in Pubble.**

1. You can select the text you want to add to your notes by selecting the text and selecting <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59350776/142134350-28005493-50a2-4316-a4b6-f4832e193d22.jpg" width="20">
 More -> 
   Add to notes, from the default text selection toolbar.
  (Additionally, you can set a title to the note and also edit the selected text before adding it to your notes. )
