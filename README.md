I always wanted a note app to which I could add anything I found that was interesting or some important note or stuff that I found on 
the internet which I would like to read or research later.

The old notes apps had always broken my focus and the momentum that I was having because I had to do a cumbersome of steps just to add something, 

1. Minimize the app I was reading on, 
2. Slide up to app menu, 
3. Click on the search bar, 
4. Struggle to write 'kwwp' and then correct it to "keep" and open the keep notes app and then tap on the plus button and then add the stuff I want..huff :\

Yes, it sucked, at least for me..., a lot.

So I thought of solving this problem by making my own notes app with extra touch-ups that reduces all those things into a TWO-STEP PROCESS.

***Say 👋 to Pubble notes , an app which make it simply quick and convinient to add notes while you do your research without loosing focus!
Isn't it flawless?***
