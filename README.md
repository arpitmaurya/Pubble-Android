I always neeeded a note app to which I could add anything I found that was interesting or some important note or stuff that I found on 
the internet which I would like to read and research on later.

It had always broke my focus and the momentum I was having due to minimize the app I was reading on , slide up to home apps , click on the searchbar
, struggle to write kwwp and then correct it to keep and open the keep notes app and then tap on the plus button and then add the stuff I want.. :\

Yes, it sucked, atleast for me..., a loooooooooooooooooooooooot.

So I thought of solving this problem through making my own notes app with extra touch ups that reduces all those things into a TWO STEP PROCESS.

Say ðŸ‘‹ to Pubble notes , an app which make it simply quick and convinient to add notes while you do your research without loosing focus!
Isn't it flawless?
